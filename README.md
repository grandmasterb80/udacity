# udacity
Anything done during Udacity courses, e.g. programming tasks and the solutions.

## Getting started - load required sources
Go to the source folder and read get_sources.md to load additional folders and
repositories. This includes data, images, point cloud data, etc. required as
input for the programs that have to be written during the Udacity course.
